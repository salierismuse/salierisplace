	<h5>you're a genius, and in the end, i'm just salieri</h5>
	<h2> hi! again, i'm salieri. i was originally a psychology student, but somehow ended up in this wonderful world of computer science.</h2>

	<p>what is there to know about me? well...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>i would love to be an indie game dev one day</li>
			<li>i love music, there's hardly a waking moment i'm not listening to it</li>
			<li>really, i just want to build or make something that makes this world a little better or little more interesting</li>
		</ul>

		<p>oh, i like anime and manga a lot! as you can likely tell, steins;gate is probably my favorite show or story of all time.

	i love the old internet. forums, old websites, a simpler time, everything. i'm a bit too young to really have experienced it, early 20s, but i got in right at the end, i was 12 years old, and i don't mean to brag, but i was the #13 highest rated user on the erin hunter community message boards. i have a soft spot in my heart for internet communities and places like that.</p>
